### How to contribute:

Download repository
`git clone https://github.com/cellador/vivid-streets.git`

To run the container and install any dependencies left (this may take a while for the first time), execute the following command in the project root
`docker-compose up --build`

To contribute, you have to first generate a new branch using
`git branch <name_of_new_branch>`
and do whatever you want! If you want to launch the page and test any changes you've made, just hit re-enter the docker-compose command above.

The `master` branch is exactly that, we since we cannot disallow people from pushing `master`, we agreed to only work on seperate branches 

(you can switch between branches using `git checkout <branch_to_checkout>`)

If you feel that you're changes should be implemented into the master branch, push your non-master branch and give me a shout.
